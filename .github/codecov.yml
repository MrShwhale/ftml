coverage:
  # TODO: Remove this when the project stabilizes
  # This section sets it so that Codecov does basically nothing but report coverage.
  # It won't fail CI, and it won't put annotations in diffs.
  # This is probably "bad" for the long run, but for now it's set like this because
  # test coverage may be inconsistent across the project for a long time.
  # Early in development this is fine, but this should get removed in the future.
