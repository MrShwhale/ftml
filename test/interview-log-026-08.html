 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;Please have a seat.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;Thank you.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;Let&#x27;s get down to business.  I understand you&#x27;re requesting a transfer out of fieldwork.  Would you like to talk about that?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;I&#x27;d rather not.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;It&#x27;s your choice.  However, I can&#x27;t approve a transfer without reason.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;Look, I…&quot;  The agent paused here.  &quot;You&#x27;ve seen my record.  You know I worked on twenty-six, right?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;I&#x27;ve read the report.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b>  &quot;I was there the first time we took one of the sleepers out.  A lot of them were adults when they disappeared, but they&#x27;re kids again when we find them.  So, I see this sixteen-year-old boy just kind of shrivel away.  I had nightmares that night.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;You&#x27;re supposed to report any unusual dreams after contacting a potentially mind-altering phenomenon.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;It hadn&#x27;t been declared a mindscrew yet.  We just thought it was a weird space thing.  We were just watching it until the Picnickers got there.  And it was a shock, you know?  We weren&#x27;t expecting anything like that.  Anyway, I got over it quick enough.  I&#x27;d seen worse.  I once had a guy melt while I was holding onto him.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;I see.  What happened next?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;Nothing, for a while.  I went in a couple of times, but didn&#x27;t see anything too weird.  But…  Look, I know I should have reported it.  But one of my buddies had just been disappeared after getting touched by some weird scip, and I didn&#x27;t want it to happen to me.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;You&#x27;ve been affected by an SCP?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;I…  Yeah.  It was a week later.  I was dozing in the back of the van, and I started dreaming.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;Can you describe this dream?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b>  &quot;Just like the others.  You&#x27;ve read the reports, right?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;Pretend that I haven&#x27;t.  For the record, Agent Walker.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;All right.  I&#x27;m in a classroom.  It&#x27;s just like one of the ones in 026, but new.  Not falling apart.  I knew the teacher&#x27;s name.  I knew who was sitting by me, even though I&#x27;d never seen most of them before.  The bell started ringing, but no one moved.  I raised my hand, but the teacher didn&#x27;t notice.  Finally, I tried to leave, but the door wouldn&#x27;t open.  Then I noticed something strange with my hand.  It had color.  Everything else was black and white.  But I felt like I was the one who was… wrong?  Out of place?  That&#x27;s when I woke up.  The van was leaving.  No one else noticed I&#x27;d been asleep.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;And you didn&#x27;t think to report this?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;Like I said, I was scared.  And this was before they found Malek.  I figured it was just another nightmare.  Nothing weird.  And after Malek had his dream, well, they didn&#x27;t do anything with him, so I figured it wasn&#x27;t a big deal.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;He was put on observation.  You should have been as well, for your own safety and for the safety of others.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;You paper-pushers think it&#x27;s all so easy, don&#x27;t you?  Sitting behind a desk all day, you don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like.  Well, things aren&#x27;t so clear out there.  Not when you&#x27;re the one hunting talking cats in a sewer, or waiting to see if you&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s not going to come back this time.&quot; <br><br>
 <br>Agent Walker was visibly distressed.  It was several minutes before she calmed down enough to continue the interview. <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t until later that we connected the dreams with the sleepers.  Not until they found those Class Ds on the second floor.  Still, I thought I might be okay.  I wasn&#x27;t actually inside of twenty-six when I dreamed.  I wasn&#x27;t sure until the dreams started.&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Dr. █████:</b> &quot;You&#x27;re having reoccurances?&quot; <br><br>
 <br><b>Agent Walker:</b> &quot;Yeah.  They started six months ago.  It&#x27;s the same dream.  But each time, it takes me a little longer to notice it isn&#x27;t real.  And when I look at my hands, they&#x27;re a little more gray.&quot; <br><br>
 <br>End interview 026-31 <br><br>
 <br><b>Note:</b> Agent Walker has since been given a Class A Amnesiac and returned to field work.
